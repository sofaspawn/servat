# SERVAT
- create a video livestreaming platform. 

# Goals
1. learn video encoding
2. learn about livestreaming
3. build something around it

# Key Concepts
- Video Encoding/Decoding:
    - Encoding: Compress raw video data into a format suitable for streaming (e.g., H.264).
    - Decoding: Decompress the video stream on the client side for playback.

- Streaming Protocols:
    - RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol): Commonly used for real-time streaming.
    - WebRTC: Low-latency protocol for peer-to-peer streaming.
    - HLS/DASH: For adaptive streaming (higher latency).

- Server and Client Communication:
    - Use a transport protocol like WebSockets or HTTP for basic streaming.
    - For better performance, use RTSP, RTMP, or WebRTC.
